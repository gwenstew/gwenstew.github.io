                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Guitar Tuner is a native MacOS application built with <b>C++</b> and <b>JUCE</b> that uses an
                    <b>autocorrelation based pitch-detection</b> to accurately detect and display the current note in real time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year I have been learning how to play the guitar and consistently ran into one problem: online guitar tuners.
                    Many were cluttered with ads, subscription fees, or distracting features that interfered with the functionality of 
                    the tuner. I wanted a simple, native app that provides and clean and reliable experience, accessible at any time.
                </p>

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>
                    During an embedded systems class in my undergraduate degreee, I learned about Fourier Transform and how it can effectively
                    detect pitch by identifying frequency peaks in a signal. While the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is efficient it was not repsonsive 
                    enough to for a real-time tuner. After some investigation I decided to implement a simple autocorrelation function to measure the 
                    periodicity of the waveform. 
                </p>

                <div class="project-subsection">
                    <h3> Autocorrelation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Autocorrelation is a mathmatical measure of the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself over varying lags.
                        It is particularly helpful in pitch detection because it can identify the repeating patterns of a signal, denoting the 
                        fundamental pitch. This is because the similarity between the signal and the lagged signal will spike at the lag that matches
                        the signal's period, thus the lag is correlated to the frequency of the signal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The function works by iterating across the range of valid time lags to determine the lag that results in the highest 
                        correlation. Once the best time delay is found, the pitch frequency is found as follows.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>pitch (Hz) = sampleRate / bestLag</code></pre>
                </div>
                
                <h2>GUI</h2>
                <p>
                    I used the JUCE framework to construct the GUI. When the current pitch is updated, it is mapped to an angular range
                    to determine the placement of the end of the dial. Linear interpolation is then applied using the previously computed
                    angle and the new angle to ensure smooth movement.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Language:</b> C++, CMake</li>
                        <li><b>Operating System:</b> MacOS</li>
                        <li><b>Framework:</b> JUCE (for audio processing and GUI)</li>
                        <li><b>Algorithms:</b> Autocorrelation-based pitch detection, binary search</li>
                        <!--<li>Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz</li>
                        <li>Latency: &lt; 10 ms average response time</li>-->
                        <li><b>Pitch Range:</b> 70–1000 Hz</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges I encountered during this project was working with the buffer. Since I was using JUCE
                    the buffer felt like a black box because I did not initially know how it was extracting data. When using the pitch
                    detection function with the audio buffer low frequency pitches could not be detected. The reason for this was the buffer
                    was not large enough to encapsulate one period of a low frequency pitch. To accurately detect the lowest typical guitar pitch
                    of around 70Hz, the buffer must contain atleast 1.5-2x the period which is around 1200 samples. To address this, I implemented a larger 
                    “mega buffer” of size 2048, which can accommodate for low-frequency signals.
