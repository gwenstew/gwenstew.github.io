                    College Kitchen is a full-stack react app designed to address a common problem in college students: cooking for themselves
                    for the first time. Meal planning can feel overwhelming when juggling school, budget and little cooking experience. College Kitchen
                    provides a way for students to plan and prepare meals. Users can create an account, track groceries in their virtual 
                    pantry, and discover recipes that make use of what they already have. This reduces food waste whilst helping students save money
                    and gain experience in the kitchen.

                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                <p>
                    College Kitchen is built with <strong>React</strong> and utilizes <strong>Google OAuth</strong> for secure 
                    authentication and <strong>Firebase</strong> for real-time database management. Recipe discovery is powered by 
                    <strong>Spoonacular API </strong>to fetch for recipes that include the ingredients from the virtual pantry.
