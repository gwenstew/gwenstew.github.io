                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project explores collaborative filtering techniques how they are
                    used to build personalized recommendations. Using the <a href="https://movielens.org">MovieLens dataset</a>,
                    I compared different collaborative filtering methods such as item-based and user-based using cosine similarity and 
                    matrix factorization to evaluate their accuracy and performance. The goal was to understand how recommendation systems
                    work behind the scenes and how mathematical models can be applied and scaled to handle larger-scale data.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    I recently lost access to my original Google Colab environment with the projects full history and results.
                    In order to keep the experiment alive I decided to <b>recreate everything from scratch</b>. This was actually very 
                    helpful in my understanding of how matrix factorization works because with retuning the training model I was able to
                    achieve results that were much better than my original analysis. It also gave me the opportunity to refactor my code
                    to make it more readable and efficient.
